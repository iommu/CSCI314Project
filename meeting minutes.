Meeting Minutes 25 April 2021

	• Going through Project part 2 document 
	• Discussion about the programming language that we cna and should use for the given project
	• Creating a github repository for the project and adding members to it.

Meeting Minutes 29 April 2021

	• Discussion on project requirement and specification. 
	• listing out some of the project that could be done and programming language that can be used
	• After discussing with the team, we decided to use python for our project.
	• Looked at various projects that we could do that was inaccordance witht he project specification. some of them were
       			1. GCC, we can automatically/randomly create code, compile it, then check the outcome
        		2. Scipy, a python library of a bunch of math functions for python, we can reimplemented some functions ourself and check ours vs theirs
       			3. An online unit conversion webpage, we can test our conversions vs what the website says
        		4. OpenCV, library with a lot of image processing functions, we can Compare the output of OpenCV with a similar python library for image processing called Pillow
	• In depth discussion on pros and cons on above mentioned project 
	• we decided to do an online unit conversion webpage, we can test our conversions vs what the website says.
	
  
	
 Meeting Minutes 9 may 2021
	
	
	• After discussing with the team, we decided to use a computational knowledge engine(Wolframe alpha) and using that vs python to validate the result.
	• Breaking down the work structure as follows. 
        1.Component : Output checker
        2.Component : Random string generator
        3.Component : Example string creation
        4.Component : WolframAlpha API
	• assigning workload to team members.
